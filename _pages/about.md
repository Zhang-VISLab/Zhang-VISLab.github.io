Vision, Intelligence, and System Laboratory (VISLab) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is led by Prof. Ziming Zhang. The aim of the lab is to engage in the state-of-the-art research into the mathematical foundation of computer vision (CV) and artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as the system design and engineering that meets the needs of society. Current research focus is **TEAM-Efficient Learning:** 
* *Training Efficiency*: Improving the convergence and training speed of learning algorithms.
* *Inference Efficiency*: Developing real-time algorithms for broader applicability.
* *Data Efficiency*: Training (deep) models using small amount of (even no) training samples.
* *Model Efficiency*: Developing hardware-friendly lightweight (deep) models & algorithms.

# About Me
I am an assistant professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Before joining WPI I was a research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) in 2016-2019. Prior to that, I was a research assistant professor at Boston University, a postdoc at Boston University working with [Prof. Venkatesh Saligrama](sites.bu.edu/data) (**Fellow of IEEE**) and a postdoc at UNC Chapel Hill working with [Prof. Dinggang Shen](http://shen.web.unc.edu) (now at the ShanghaiTech University, **Fellows of IEEE, AIMBE, IAPR**). I received PhD in 2013 from Oxford Brookes University, UK, under the supervision of [Prof. Philip H. S. Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) (now at the University of Oxford, **Fellows of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering**). My research areas lie in computer vision and machine learning, especially in deep learning, zero-shot learning, optimization, 2D/3D object recognition/detection/segmentation, person re-identification, video retrieval, point cloud processing, IoT, autonomous driving, and time-series data analysis. My works have appeared in PAMI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, NIPS, ACM MM, ICDM. I serve as a review/PC member for top conferences (e.g. CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, AISTATS, IJCAI) and journals (e.g. PAMI, IJCV, JMLR). My work "Deep Learning-based Water Detector" won the [R&D100 Award 2018](https://www.merl.com/news/award-20181116-1254).
