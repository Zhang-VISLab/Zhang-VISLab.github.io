**Vision, Intelligence, and System Laboratory (VISLab)** at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is led by **Prof. Ziming Zhang**. The aim of the lab is to engage in the state-of-the-art research into the mathematical foundation of computer vision (CV) and artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as the hardware design and engineering that meets the needs of society. Current research focus is **TEAM-Efficient Learning**, i.e., 
* *Training Efficiency*: Improving the convergence and training speed of learning algorithms.
* *Inference Efficiency*: Real-time algorithmic implementation for significant application impact.
* *Data Efficiency*: Training (deep) models using small amount of (even no) training samples.
* *Memory Efficiency*: Developing lightweight (deep) models to meet hardware requirements.

# About Me
Dr. Ziming Zhang is an assistant professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Before joining WPI he was a research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) in 2016-2019. Prior to that, he was a research assistant professor at Boston University. Dr. Zhang received his PhD in 2013 from Oxford Brookes University, UK, under the supervision of [Prof. Philip H. S. Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) (now in the University of Oxford). His research areas lie in computer vision and machine learning, especially in deep learning, zero-shot learning, optimization, 2D/3D object recognition/detection/segmentation, person re-identification, video retrieval, point cloud processing, IoT, autonomous driving, and time-series data analysis. His works have appeared in PAMI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, NIPS. He serves as a review/PC member for top conferences (e.g. CVPR, ICCV, NIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, AISTATS, IJCAI) and journals (e.g. PAMI, IJCV, JMLR). His work "Deep Learning-based Water Detector" won the [R&D100 Award 2018](https://www.merl.com/news/award-20181116-1254).
